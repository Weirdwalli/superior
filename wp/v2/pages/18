We strive every day to provide a safe work environment and mindset for our employees and work diligently to create a zero-incident company. Any accident or injury on a jobsite receives upper management\u2019s thorough review of how, why, and what we can learn from each situation. We have invested in an award-winning health, safety, and environmental (HSE) group that tirelessly innovates and coordinates with our exposed employees to minimize risk and create a safe work culture both internally and for the public.<\/span> <\/p>\n<h2>Client Experience<\/h2>\n<p><strong>\u201cA safe work environment provides financial benefits and reduces disruptions \u2014 and it\u2019s our moral duty to do so.\u201d<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>\u2014 Nick Largura, CEO<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our extensive program, developed over multiple generations of input and experiences, allows employees to focus on the task at hand, which is to be the \u201ccontractor of choice.\u201d Our clients benefit from the focus we have on each specific work activity by minimizing disruptions to project progress and reducing exposure to the public. This dedication to safety is seen in the work we deliver every day and is highlighted by our industry-leading safety record.<\/span> <\/p>\n<h2>Planning<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We begin planning a project-specific safety plan far before construction begins, often requiring the pursuit team to outline how to build safely prior to bid. Our proven framework aligns production and safety goals, proactively identifying hazards and ultimately reducing risk while emphasizing safety over all else. From the top executive through each position, we all are required to abide by those same standards as defined in our corporate HSE manual to project-specific plans. Each employee is encouraged to think daily about the potential impact if a task went wrong and then plan accordingly. We plan the work and work the plan.<\/span> <\/p>\n<h2>HSE trained &#038; certified professionals<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our team of trained and certified safety professionals are proactive partners and industry experts.
